# Critical Evaluation

## 7.1 Critical Evaluation of the Module, its Usage, and Relation with Other Subjects

This database module greatly helped in gaining knowledge about database concepts from basic to intermediate level. The way it is structured has simplified and boosted the learning process. It provides practical learning and hands-on experience, which is essential for performing operations on real-world scenarios.  

The implementation of databases as a module helps both in academic as well as occupational and professional scenarios. It provides foundational knowledge for organizing and managing data in a structured format, like creating tables, declaring columns, their data types, and constraints. This module also covered core database concepts such as normalization and querying. It helps create scalable systems, which are crucial in today's real-world scenarios.  

The database module works well in relation to other subjects, such as programming languages, web development, and machine learning. It also correlates with the Information Systems module studied in the first year of this course.  

Therefore, this module has been an essential aspect of this course that helped develop various skills and knowledge, which are highly required in almost every IT field today.

## 7.2 Critical Assessment of Coursework

In this coursework, a consistent database system had to be developed for an organization to store staff data and college resources. The database system needed to be consistent, maintain data integrity, and minimize redundancy as much as possible. To maintain this, normalization was performed up to 3NF. This helped remove both partial and transitive dependencies.  

Normalization was the most puzzling part throughout the whole coursework. It was performed in a stepwise manner: UNF, 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF. Initial and final ERDs were developed for better visualization of the database.

This coursework was more than just an assessment; it was a journey filled with emotions. Various thoughtful decisions were made, and obstacles and setbacks were faced. Nonetheless, they were essential in building not only professional skills but also the mindset required to solve problems and maintain a steady approach throughout the project development. This assessment has greatly inspired me to seek more information on database-related modules, and I look forward to gaining more knowledge and solving any obstacles that come my way.
